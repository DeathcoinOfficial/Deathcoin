### Deathcoin smart insurance
The Deathcoin smart insurance will protect you from all sorts of financial crisis. It is an intelligent, proprietary fail-safe mechanism designed and tested rigorously, by our industry researchers, built on top of the Trc20 blockchain with a smart contract. During major financial crashes, our automated intelligent liqudity controlling system will retire a calculated amount of Deathcoin. The price of the remaining Deathcoin will rise and protect you from the gay bears.

The smart contract is currently under Alpha phase and will be launched after our risk management analyst's audit.

```python 
def smart_insurance(financial_crisis_indicator):
'''Pseudo code for Deathcoin smart insurance'''
  total = 0
  if financial_crisis_indicator > thresholds:
    crashed_pct = calculate_crashed_pct(financial_crisis_indicator)
    no_of_burned_coin = burn_deathcoin()
    print(f'Fail safe mechanism activated, {no_of_burned_coin} Deathcoins have been sent to Hell.')
    total += no_of_burned_coin
    profit = get_deathcoin_profit()
    when profit < crashed_pct:
      no_of_burned_coin = burn_deathcoin()
      print(f'Second layer of Fail safe mechanism activated, extra {no_of_burned_coin} Deathcoins have been sent to Hell.')
      profit += get_deathcoin_profit()
      total += no_of_burned_coin
  print(f"Smart insurance have protected us. {total} Deathcoin have been sent to Hell. It died so we could live.")
