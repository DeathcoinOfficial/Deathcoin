### What is Deathcoin?

Deathcoin (Token symbol: DIE) is a technology that united all investors who have been involved in scam and Ponzi projects. These investors usually never learn. 

``Fool me once, shame on you! Fool me twice?``

Our doctrine is you can get fooled by all other shit coins, but Deathcoin will always be with you. DIE is fully decentralized and there is no exit strategy for our core team members. Deathcoin’s price can only go up and you will experience a perpetual Bull market in Deathcoin.

One of our founding fathers died of acute propofol intoxication after a massive loss in participating in a Ponzi scheme. In supporting Deathcoin, you will also be supporting suicide prevention as we make our periodic Deathcoin donation to the Samaritans and its volunteers.

Deathcoin - you can use it for a funeral, veneration of the dead or donation. Do not bring flowers to a funeral, it is not environmentally friendly. Harness the power of Blockchain technology and send some real currency to your loved one. Insert Deathcoins into the coffin.  

### A fairer financial system

Today, billions of people can’t open bank accounts, others have their loan blocked. Deathcoin's decentralized finance (DeFi) system never sleeps or discriminates. With just an internet connection, you can send, receive, borrow, earn interest, and even stream funds anywhere in the world.
